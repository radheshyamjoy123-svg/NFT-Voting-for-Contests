# NFT Voting Contest Smart Contract

## Description

The NFT Voting Contest is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables fair and transparent voting for NFT collections. Users can participate in contests by voting for their favorite NFTs using their token IDs, with the system automatically tracking votes and determining winners based on community preferences.

The smart contract implements a secure voting mechanism that prevents double voting, maintains real-time vote counting, and automatically updates the leading NFT throughout the contest duration. Each user can cast only one vote per contest, ensuring democratic participation while maintaining the integrity of the voting process.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize how NFT communities engage with digital art and collectibles by creating a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven platform for NFT contests. We aim to empower creators, collectors, and enthusiasts to showcase their favorite NFTs while building stronger community bonds through democratic participation.

We envision a future where NFT voting becomes a standard mechanism for community decision-making, helping to establish genuine value and recognition for digital artworks based on authentic community sentiment rather than just market speculation.
